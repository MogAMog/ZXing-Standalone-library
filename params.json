  "body": "# Overview\r\nThis is the library modified from the original [ZXing Project](https://github.com/zxing/zxing). The code is not modified in any way but is just compiled into a library so that the end user doesn't have to download the scanner app separately.\r\n\r\n# Adding the library \r\nAdd this line (if not already present there) in the project's `build.gradle` file\r\n\r\n    repositories {\r\n        jcenter()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAdd this statement in the `dependencies` block of app's `build.gradle` file\r\n\r\n    compile 'com.tarun0.zxing-standalone:zxing-standalone:1.0.0'\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\nSend an intent when you need to scan, like on clicking on a button\r\n\r\n    Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(),CaptureActivity.class);\r\n                intent.setAction(\"com.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN\");\r\n                intent.putExtra(\"SAVE_HISTORY\", false);\r\n                startActivityForResult(intent, 0);\r\n\r\nHandle the result from the intent by overriding 'onActivityResult'\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\r\n            if (requestCode == 0) {\r\n                if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {\r\n                    String contents = data.getStringExtra(\"SCAN_RESULT\");\r\n                    Log.d(TAG, \"contents: \" + contents);\r\n                } else if (resultCode == RESULT_CANCELED) {\r\n                    Log.d(TAG, \"RESULT_CANCELED\");\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n* Please consider going through this answer by one of the original authors before including the app in your project, here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9942761\r\n* To compile the library yourself from the original source, follow [this step by step tutorial](http://stackoverflow.com/a/38423626/2922480).\r\n\r\n#License\r\nAll the portions of the software/code are licensed under [Apache-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), if not mentioned otherwise.",
